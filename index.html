            It was Monday morning, garbage day. I overslept a little bit because I was up until 11 P.M. doing chess lessons. So I had to hurry down and get out of my robe and get dressed. I'm kind of embarrassed to walk outside in my robe. I really should have filled the garbage and recycling cans the night before. They were mostly full but I hate leaving empty, unused space. So I foraged around my garage looking for things to throw out. Luckily the kids were still asleep so I could throw out some of their junky old toys. They won't even notice they are gone, but if I had told them I was going to throw the toys out they would protest incessantly. I still had some room, so I went through some of wifey's momentos in the garage. I probably shouldn't throw this out but it looks like garbage. Hey, there are some Amazon boxes I can toss. I wish she wouldn't buy so much stuff off Amazon. Why do her parents give us all of their old garbage? Is decorative grass really worth handing down?

            I like when the garbage can lids are slightly pushed upwards because they are full. Not too much to arouse the suspicion of the garbage collectors, but enough where I feel like I'm getting some extra bang for my buck. I put my gloves on and start hauling the cans down the driveway. I have to walk through the grass a bit because the cars are parked in the driveway. I need to cut the grass. I'm not sure how it got this long during a drought, but here we are. I finally made it to the bottom of the driveway and placed the cans. I leave a little space between them as a courtesy to the collectors. How can the garbage truck robot arms grab a single can if they are too close together? All of a sudden I see a car approaching. I didn't recognize this car and as it got closer I realized I didn't recognize the driver either. They waved as they drove by, but I really didn't trust the wave. Was this really someone who just moved into the neighborhood. I guess I haven't been here that long, maybe I had just never seen them before. They were probably on their way to work.
